# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier – ML Assignment

This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python and scikit-learn. It's part of my hands-on machine learning coursework and showcases foundational concepts in classification, feature importance, and model evaluation.

## 📁 File Included

- `DecisionTreeassignment_Student.ipynb`  
  A Jupyter notebook containing:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model training using `DecisionTreeClassifier`
  - Visualization of the decision tree
  - Accuracy and performance metrics
  - Insights on model interpretability

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Learning Objectives

- Understand the working of decision trees in classification problems.
- Learn how to split data, train models, and interpret decision boundaries.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
- Visualize decision paths and feature importance.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the dependencies (if not already):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
